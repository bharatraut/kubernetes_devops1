# Kubernetes-k8s-Handwritten-notes-by-Mohd-Imran
This repository contains my hand written notes of Kubernetes. These notes have everything about Kubernetes you need to learn. It contains all the commands, important terminologies, etc. with examples. I am sharing my notes because I believe in learning in public so I am sharing whatever I am learning with the community. Hope my notes helps you and share this with your people.
